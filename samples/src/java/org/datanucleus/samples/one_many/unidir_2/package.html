    Demonstration of a 1-N unidirectional relationship with inheritance, and relation at the root level.
    This is similar to samples.one_many.unidir and can be used where there are multiple ways of mapping
    such a relation. For example you could map the one_many.unidir with subclass-table, and map this using
    new-table for all tables.
