This file contains the list of modifications made to the spider workspace to
enable the new signature test framework and remove the old framework.

- All files were removed from the src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest directory.
  This includes all files in any sub-directories.
- The new test framework code was added to the src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest
  directory.  Files include:
    README                     SigTestData.java           j2ee/
    SCCS/                      SigTestEE.java             modifications.txt
    SampleSigTest.java.txt     SigTestResult.java         record-build.xml
    SampleSigTestEE.java.txt   SigTestUtil.java           signature-repository/
    SigTest.java               build.xml
  NOTE: Do not ship record-build.xml with any deliverable.
- A signaturerepository directory was created under the
  src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest directory.  This directory holds the
  signature files and a README file.
- A j2ee directory was created under the src/com/sun/ts/tests/signaturetest
  directory.  This directory contains the J2EE TCK (CTS) signature tests.
  Files include:
    J2EESigTest.java   SCCS/              build.xml

INSTALL DIRECTORY
-----------------
- Added a sig-test.map file to the install/j2ee/bin.  This file contains the
  package versions to be used by the J2EE TCK sig tests.
- Added "permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "createClassLoader";" and 
  "permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";"
  to the install/j2ee/bin/java.policy file.
- Added "permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "createClassLoader";" and
  "permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";"
  to the install/j2ee/bin/server_policy.append file.
- Appended ${ts.home}/lib/apiCheck.jar to the ts.classpath property in the
  file install/j2ee/bin/build.properties
- Modified the classpath for the property env.ts_unix.command.testExecute in
  file install/j2ee/bin/ts.jte by adding :${TS_HOME}/lib/apiCheck.jar.
- Modified the classpath for the property env.ts_win32.command.testExecute in
  file install/j2ee/bin/ts.jte by adding ;${TS_HOME}\\lib\\apiCheck.jar

TS HARNESS CHANGES
------------------
- Added a loging utility to support API check.  Simple adapter pattern to
  convert API check logging calls to TestUtil.logMsg calls.  Added files:
    src/com/sun/ts/lib/util/SigLogIntf.java
    src/com/sun/ts/lib/util/SigLogAdapter.java
  NOTE: This change requires the lib/tsharness.jar to be rebuilt.
- Added API check utility by adding file lib/apiCheck.jar.
- Added API check record utility by adding file lib/recordApiCheck.jar.  NOTE
  do not ship this jar with any deliverable.

API CHECK CHANGES
-----------------
- API Check now has a dependency on tsharness.jar for logging facilities.
- Changed the logging facility of API check so it uses TestUtil.
- Changed all System.err calls to use TestUtil as well.
- Prevented sub-packages from automatically being checked.
